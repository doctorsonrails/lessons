# Mark Up A Document

Your task is to turn your CV from text to HTML, by marking everything up with tags.

A list of HTML5 tags can be found at [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) - use whichever ones you think best suit your objective.

The final document should be roughly structured like this:

```
<html>
    <head>
        <title>...</title>
    </head>
    
    <body>
        <header>...</header>
        ...
    </body>
</html>
```
